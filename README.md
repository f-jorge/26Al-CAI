- this python code utilizes the plotly graphing library to create two plots using 26Al data collected by Dr. Emilie Dunham
- the plots created are a histogram with accompanying kernel density estimation (KDE) of 26Al/27Al ratios in respect to different chondrite types and a scatter plot of 26Al/27Al ratios and their corresponding grain sizes
