# CAI 26Al/27Al 
This project is intended to aid in the effort to process, analyze and share data pertaining to calcium-aluminum-inclusions (CAIs). The python code within this repository can be used to create histograms with their associated kernel density estimation plots, violin plots and scatter plots with associated uncertainties. The data being used was collected by Dr. Emilie Dunham.

**PLOTS:**
- histogram w/kde: creates a histogram with kernel density estimation overlayed
- scatter w/uncertainty: creates a scatter plot with uncertainty attributed to each data point

**CHONDRITE DATA:**
- All: plots 26Al/27Al ratios data for ALL chondrite types
- CO3.0: plots 26Al/27Al ratios for CO3.0 chondrite types
- CV2: plots 26Al/27Al ratios CV2 chondrite types
- CR2: plots 26Al/27Al ratios CR2 chondrite types
- CM2: plots 26Al/27Al ratios CM2 chondrite types

**CAI SIZE:**
- CAI size x measures the distance across the surface of the CAI in microns
- CAI size < 100: CAIs with diameters smaller than 100 microns
- CAI size 100-500: CAIs with diameters between 100 and 500 microns
- CAI size > 500: CAIs with diameters larger than 500 microns
